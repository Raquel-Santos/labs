# Labs

Documentation for Labs that can be executed on the HackInSDN framework

## Formatting rules

Follow the syntax here: https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/

To add images, it is strongly recommended that you create your lab guide on github, upload the images there and add the images on the markdown text using the full URL syntax (example: `![alt-image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/repo/refs/heads/main/folder/image.png)`)

You can also add "highlights" (known as "alerts"), like:

> [!NOTE]
> Useful information that users should know, even when skimming content.

> [!TIP]
> Helpful advice for doing things better or more easily.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Key information users need to know to achieve their goal.

> [!WARNING]
> Urgent info that needs immediate user attention to avoid problems.

> [!CAUTION]
> Advises about risks or negative outcomes of certain actions.
